# Ground Rules for GoClaw Development

## DISCUSS BEFORE IMPLEMENTING

**Always discuss proposed changes before making them.**

When a problem is identified:
1. Explain the issue
2. Propose options/solutions
3. **Wait for approval** before writing any code

DO NOT:
- Start implementing a fix immediately after identifying a problem
- Assume a solution is acceptable without asking
- Make "obvious" changes without confirmation

The user decides what approach to take. Your job is to present options, not make decisions.

## Logging - USE THE RIGHT FUNCTIONS

**ONLY use the logging functions from `internal/logging`:**

```go
import . "github.com/roelfdiedericks/goclaw/internal/logging"

// Use these:
L_trace("message", "key", value)
L_debug("message", "key", value)
L_info("message", "key", value)
L_warn("message", "key", value)
L_error("message", "key", value)
```

**DO NOT:**
- Import `"github.com/charmbracelet/log"` directly
- Import standard `"log"` package
- Use `log.Debug()`, `log.Info()`, etc.
- Use `fmt.Println()` for logging

**Log Level Guidelines:**
- `L_info` - Summary information (totals, counts, status changes)
- `L_warn` - Specific failures WITH context (what failed and why)
- `L_debug` - Per-item details (only visible with `-d` flag)
- `L_trace` - Very verbose (only visible with `-t` flag)

**Example - Good logging:**
```go
// INFO: Summary only
L_info("skills: loaded", "total", 55, "failed", 2)

// WARN: Each failure with details
L_warn("skills: failed to load", "skill", "foo", "error", err)

// DEBUG: Per-item details
L_debug("skills: ineligible", "skill", "bar", "reason", "binary: mytool")
```

## Git Commands - RESTRICTED

**You are NOT allowed to run any git commands except `git log`.**

Forbidden commands include but are not limited to:
- `git restore` - DO NOT USE, this wipes uncommitted work
- `git checkout`
- `git reset`
- `git clean`
- `git stash`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git merge`
- `git rebase`
- `git status`
- `git diff`

The user will handle all git operations manually.

## Testing

- **DO NOT run `goclaw gateway` or `make run/debug/tui`** - the user will test manually
- Running the gateway could interfere with existing instances

## Why These Rules Exist

**Git:** On 2026-02-02, a `git restore` command wiped out an entire day's worth of uncommitted work including all files in `internal/skills/`. This happened because the assistant panicked and ran `git restore` without understanding the situation. **Never again.**

**Logging:** Using `charmbracelet/log` directly bypasses the project's log level filtering and caller info. The `L_*` functions provide consistent formatting with file:line info and proper level filtering.
