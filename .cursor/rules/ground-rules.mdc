# Ground Rules for GoClaw Development

## Git Commands - RESTRICTED

**You are NOT allowed to run any git commands except `git log`.**

Forbidden commands include but are not limited to:
- `git restore` - DO NOT USE, this wipes uncommitted work
- `git checkout`
- `git reset`
- `git clean`
- `git stash`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `git push`
- `git pull`
- `git merge`
- `git rebase`
- `git status`
- `git diff`

The user will handle all git operations manually.

## Testing

- **DO NOT run `goclaw gateway` or `make run/debug/tui`** - the user will test manually
- Running the gateway could interfere with existing instances

## Why This Rule Exists

On 2026-02-02, a `git restore` command wiped out an entire day's worth of uncommitted work including:
- All files in `internal/skills/` (9 Go files)
- Changes to `internal/gateway/gateway.go`
- Changes to `internal/skills/manager.go`
- Changes to `internal/context/prompt.go`
- And more

This happened because git showed files as "deleted" and the assistant panicked and ran `git restore --staged . && git restore .` without understanding the situation.

**Never again.**
